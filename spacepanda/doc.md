* **Originality:** What is original about your game?

My game has an original arcade style gameplay. Its not exacly innovative, but it
is simple enough to provide a fun experience. To my knowledge, there is no game
with similar gameplay.

* **Technical Merit:** What is interesting about your game technology?

My game shows technical merit through its menus, random object generation, and
both single player and multi player game modes.

* **Prototype Postmortem:** What did you learn from this prototype? What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?

I learned from this prototype so many things. Firstly, I learned how microStudio
and the microScript programming language work. Secondly, I learned how to make
multiple game states such as single player and multi player in the same game.
Next, I learned how to get input from a user. Next, I learned how to save hi scores
as global variables. Lastly, I learned random object generation and collision
detection. These are the major points of learning for me.

* **Prototype Assets:** Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

All prototype assets were created from scratch, EXCEPT for the panda's base.
The panda (not with the hats) came from a free use pixel art site called
Brik at https://www.brik.co . However, the asset no longer avaiable as it was
removed from the site at some point. The free work can still be found on Twitter
at https://twitter.com/brikpixelart/status/702220240843890688

* **Prototype Closest Other Game:** Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code, you must say so here.

To my knowledge, there is not a game that is similar to this. My idea was entirely
original. If I had to choose something, the classic arcade game Asteroids may
be the most similar

Code was borrowed AND MODIFIED from the mrLman tutorials for the collision 
detection, collectible, and end screen. Code was borrowed and NOT MODIFIED from
mrLman's games prog library v0.2 helper functions for the clamp(), distance(), and
randRange() functions.

* **High Concept:** A one-sentence summary of your game.

You are a Space Panda, the last of your kind, set on collecting
all the rainbow stars from outer space -- But look out for meteors! Space is a 
dangerous place.

* **Theme:** State which of the themes or challenges you used.

Theme used- 

You are in a bear costume. 

Challenge used- 

Starlight - Your game world is inspired by stars and 
constellations.

Moving the goalposts - The win condition of the game changes in some way each
time it is played

* **Mandated Variety:** State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.

Input - Keyboard (Arrow keys for single player, WASD keys for multi player)

Randomness - Enemies (meteors) spawn at random spots on the edges of the screen,
and collectables (stars) spawn at random points on the screen itself.

Genre - Arcade

Play style - Top down gameplay

* **Prototype Goal:** What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?

The goal of this prototype is to evaluate top down gameplay along with random
object generation (stars and meteors). Additionally, my own goal of this prototype
was to learn how to use microStudio and program in microScript.

* **Player Experience Goals:** What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?

I want players to have fun, and be constantly challenging themselves to "just 
one more try." The game can get frustrating, but that is what makes it addictive!

* **Gameplay:** A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not

The entire game is playable via keyboard input in fullscreen. From the menu, 
there are two selectable modes: single player and multi player. Single player is
selectable using the left arrow key, and multi player using the right arrow key.
In single and multi player, player 1 panda is controlled using the arrow keys.
In multi player only, player 2 panda is controlled using the WASD keys. Stars
are collected via collision detection and increase the player's score. Hi scores
are saved between games. The player must restart if there is collision detected
with a meteor. Although there is no end to the game as it is arcade style
gameplay, there is an unlockable crown hat if the player is able to reach a
score of 50 (difficult, but doable!).

* **Strategies:** What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?

There are two key strategies in this game. The first is to know that there will
only be 4 meteors on screen at any given time, 1 coming from each direction. So,
if there is a meteor already on screen from the edge where a star has spawned
near, it is perfectly safe to go and collect that star. Just pay attention to
the meteor speeds! The second strategy is much more simple... Play it safe! It is
not always worth it to go for the next star immediately, so just be patient.

* **Story/Setting/Premise:** A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so. How will the dramatic tensio with the gameplay tension?

You are a Space Panda, the last of your kind, set on collecting
all the rainbow stars from outer space -- But look out for meteors! Space is a 
dangerous place. 

The game has a simple presise with simple arcade style gameplay!

* **Target Audience:** A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.

The target audience is anyone that likes playing games and can use a computer! :)

* **Play Time:** How long does your game take to play?

A single round can be over in just a matter of seconds, but as you play you may 
find your playtime to be rapidly increasing! They key here is the restart button,
it is very easy to keep on playing. Think Flappy Bird!
