This was the first game that I ever made. I created it for an intro to game programming class in college.

To run the game locally, simply download the code and open the index.html file. Alternatively, check out the game on itch.io!

The game can be played using the keyboard, and supports up to two players on a single device.

***

You are a Space Panda, the last of your kind, set on collecting all the rainbow stars from outer space -- But look out for meteors! Space is a dangerous place.

Reach a high score of 50 to unlock a secret hat ;)
